ML - Using Polynomial Regression to find the Salary for given Experience

Title: Projected Salaries with Polynomial Regression (Jupyter Notebook)

Description:

This Jupyter Notebook implements polynomial regression to predict projected salaries based on experience level. It explores different polynomial degrees, hyperparameter tuning, and provides visualizations to understand the relationship between experience and salary.

Features:

Polynomial regression: Fits a polynomial model to the data to capture non-linear relationships between experience and salary.
Hyperparameter tuning: Evaluates different polynomial degrees using cross-validation to find the best fit for the data.
Visualizations: Creates scatter plots and error plots to visualize the data and model performance.
Instructions:

Install dependencies: Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook and required libraries (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn) installed.
Open and run: Open the polynomial_regression.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and run the code cells sequentially.
Interpretation: The notebook provides visualizations and metrics (e.g., R-squared) to interpret the model's performance and salary predictions based on experience.
Example Usage:

This model also talks about
1. How to find a optimal degree
2. Applying the best Regularization (Ridge, Lasso)
